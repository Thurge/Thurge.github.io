# Todd Bello's Undergrad Education

I attended [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/) where I got a B.S. in [Game Design and Development](https://www.rit.edu/study/game-design-and-development-bs) within the [Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences](https://www.rit.edu/computing/). 

My main focus was building a graphics engine and working with game engines to build prototypes within quick 10-week time frames (This was when RIT was on the quarter system, which they have since converted to the semester system).

I also minored in Computer Science (with a focus on low level assembly programming and graphics courses) and Music & Technology (Got to help build one of [RIT's recording studios](https://www.rit.edu/facilities/sound-capture-room))
