## Sarcasm Script

In March of 2020 Todd was bored during the pandemic so he thought he'd try to venture into modern Android Application development by making an app in Kotlin. 

The application was simple. Make titles like [this satirical subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeopleFuckingDying/) 

[Example](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeopleFuckingDying/comments/1kbd0ox/helpless_chap_sustains_grevious_injuries_after/):

hElPleSs cHaP sUsTaInS gReViOuS iNjUrIeS aFtEr FoUl BeAsT aTtAcK
   But it's a guy getting poked at by a bird

Hilarious!

But the act of making these titles is hard to type out.

Which adds to the idea that what is being read is sarcasm.

No need for /s at the end if it's obvious at first sight!

Example:

Hoping to re-release app on the Google Play Store soon!
